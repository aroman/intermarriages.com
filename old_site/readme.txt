 Also, if you like this software and want to express your gratitude
 or to encourage further development, feel free to donate some money,
 or even hardware. I'm a student and would happily accept any
 donations. Please do not send cheques, as cashing them in is 
 very  expensive in Germany. US cash would be ok.

 Any donations are welcome, send them to
